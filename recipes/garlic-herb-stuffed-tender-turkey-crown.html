    <h1>Garlic and herb stuffed tender turkey crown</h1>
    <p>
        Hosting Christmas dinner for six? This turkey crown is a great option. The garlic and herb stuffing adds loads of flavour while keeping the meat juicy
    </p>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2-2Â½kg turkey crown
            on the bone</li>
        <li>150g garlic & herb soft cheese</li>
        <li>25g butter
            melted</li>
        <li>150ml white wine or dry sherry</li>
        <li>200ml chicken stock</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Method</p>

            <p>step 1</p>
            <p>
                Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 6. Lift the skin on the crown, and carefully push your hand underneath until you can reach all the way down. Push half the soft cheese under the skin of each breast, then massage the skin so the cheese is spread out under the skin and covers the whole crown.

            <p>step 2</p>
            <p>
                Put the turkey in a roasting tin, skin-side up. Brush the skin with some of the butter and season with salt. Roast for 30 mins, then brush with a bit more butter. Roast for another 1 hr, brushing with the remaining butter once more, until the crown is cooked through. If you have a meat thermometer, it should read 65C when inserted into the thickest part of the breast. Alternatively, insert a skewer and ensure the juices run clear.

            <p>step 3</p>
            <p>
                Transfer the turkey to a board or warm dish to catch any juices, and leave to rest for at least 20 mins. Meanwhile, pour the wine into the roasting tin and scrape and browned bits from the bottom. If the tin is flameproof, bring to the boil directly over a high heat, or pour everything into a saucepan first. Cook until reduced to a syrup, then add the stock and any resting juices. Continue to cook until reduced by half, about 10 mins. Carve the turkey in long slices and serve with the sauce.
