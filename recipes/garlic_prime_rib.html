    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        A tasty prime rib marinade made with olive oil, garlic, and thyme. I was trusted with this recipe but I can't
        keep it to myself!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 pound) prime rib roast</li>
        <li>10 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients for marinade.</li>
        <li>Mix garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Place roast in a roasting pan with the fatty side up. Spread mixture over the top of roast; let roast sit
            out until it is at room temperature, no longer than 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; reduce the temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C),
            and continue roasting for an additional 60 to 75 minutes. The internal temperature of the roast should be at
            135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium rare.
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow roast to rest for 10 or 15 minutes before carving so the meat can retain its juices.
        </li>
    </ol>
