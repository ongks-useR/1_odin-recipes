    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons seasoned salt</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans cola-flavored carbonated beverage</li>
        <li>1 medium apple, quartered</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups hickory wood chips, or more as needed (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rinse turkey under cold water, and pat dry.</li>
        <li>
            Rub crushed garlic over the outside of the turkey, and sprinkle with seasoned salt. Transfer to a disposable
            roasting pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill the turkey cavity with butter, cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cover turkey
            loosely with foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add wood chips to the smoker according to the manufacturer's directions. Place the roasting pan in the
            preheated smoker. Smoke the turkey, basting every 1 to 2 hours with juices from the bottom of the roasting
            pan, for 5 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add more wood chips if desired. Continue smoking and basting, until turkey is no longer pink at the bone and
            the juices run clear, about 5 more hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the
            thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).
        </li>
    </ol>
